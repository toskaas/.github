# Toskaas

Quietly building useful things.

Toskaas is a small holding company for independent software products and infrastructure projects. This GitHub org is where we keep the code, tooling, and shared components that support our work.

## Projects

- **Classia** (http://classia.co.uk)<br />
  Class management for studios and teachers. Scheduling, enrolments, payments, and the admin that nobody enjoys doing.

- **UK DNS Privacy Project** (http://dnsprivacy.org.uk)<br />
  Privacy-first DNS infrastructure and related tooling.

## What you’ll find here

- Shared libraries and internal tooling
- Experiments that may become real things

## Principles

- Build small, ship carefully  
- Prefer clarity over cleverness  
- Maintain what we ship  
- Keep the admin low and the quality high
